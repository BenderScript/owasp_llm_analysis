## Research Summary

This repository's research focuses on the security aspects of LLMs, including the risks associated with training data, prompt injections, and application-level security for LLM-based systems like chatbots. It covers the importance of balancing preventive measures, like clean training data, with reactive strategies against risks outlined in the OWASP LLM Top 10. Additionally, it explores specific scenarios like the integration of LLMs in enterprise environments with OpenAI and open-source models, providing insights into unique challenges and security considerations in these contexts.
