### Assumptions of the Relationship Between Enterprise and OpenAI

- **Service Provider Relationship:** The enterprise is a client of OpenAI, using ChatGPT as a service. The enterprise has no control over OpenAI's internal models, security practices, or data handling.
- **Data Handling:** The enterprise is responsible for the data it inputs into ChatGPT, including any sensitive information.
- **Integration Responsibility:** The enterprise is responsible for securely integrating ChatGPT into its systems and workflows.
- **Compliance and Legal Constraints:** The enterprise must adhere to the terms of service set by OpenAI and is legally bound not to attempt reverse engineering or unauthorized access to the underlying models.
- **Service Availability:** The enterprise has no control over the availability of ChatGPT services and must plan for potential downtimes.
- **Security Practices:** The enterprise cannot audit or directly influence OpenAI's security practices but must rely on OpenAI's assurances and public reputation for service security and reliability.

### Risk Analysis for Enterprise Use of ChatGPT Services

#### 1. **LLM01: Prompt Injection**
- **Risk:** High
- **Impact:** Manipulation of ChatGPT to execute unintended or harmful actions.
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Practical Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation at the user interface level. Train users on secure and responsible usage of ChatGPT.

#### 2. **LLM02: Insecure Output Handling**
- **Risk:** Moderate
- **Impact:** Misleading or harmful outputs affecting business decisions.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate
- **Practical Mitigation:** Develop a post-processing layer that reviews and sanitizes ChatGPT outputs before they are used or displayed.

#### 3. **LLM03: Training Data Poisoning**
- **Risk:** High
- **Impact:** Biased or unethical responses.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate
- **Practical Mitigation:** Educate users about the possibility of biases. Supplement ChatGPT's responses with additional data sources for critical decision-making.

#### 4. **LLM04: Model Denial of Service**
- **Risk:** Moderate
- **Impact:** Interruption in service availability.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate

- **Practical Mitigation:** Maintain diversified solutions and avoid over-dependence on a single AI provider.

#### 6. **LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure**
- **Risk:** High
- **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information.
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Practical Mitigation:** Establish strict data governance policies to prevent sharing sensitive data with ChatGPT. Implement data classification and handling protocols.

#### 7. **LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design**
- **Risk:** Moderate to High
- **Impact:** Exploitation of insecure integrations.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate
- **Practical Mitigation:** Rigorously evaluate and secure all enterprise-side integrations and APIs that interact with ChatGPT.

#### 8. **LLM08: Excessive Agency**
- **Risk:** Moderate
- **Impact:** Over-dependence on AI-driven decisions.
- **Likelihood:** Moderate
- **Practical Mitigation:** Establish protocols where critical decisions are reviewed and validated by domain experts.

#### 9. **LLM09: Overreliance**
- **Risk:** High
- **Impact:** Erroneous decision-making based on AI output.
- **Likelihood:** High
- **Practical Mitigation:** Implement a system of checks and balances, including human oversight, for decisions informed by ChatGPT.

#### 10. **LLM10: Model Theft**
- **Risk:** Low
- **Impact:** Legal and ethical repercussions.
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Practical Mitigation:** Adhere to legal and contractual agreements with OpenAI. Educate users on the ethical use of ChatGPT and compliance with service terms.
